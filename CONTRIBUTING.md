Contributing to TheoTech Moral AI Framework
Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TheoTech Moral AI Framework! This project represents groundbreaking work in AI ethics and moral philosophy, and we welcome collaboration from researchers, developers, philosophers, and ethicists.
üéØ Project Vision
We're building the first computational implementation of Thomistic conscience theory, creating AI systems with authentic moral sensitivity. Our goal is to develop AI that doesn't just follow moral rules, but actually experiences appropriate moral concern and grows in moral wisdom.

Moral Reasoning Tests
def test_principle_violation_detection():
    """Test that synderesis engine correctly identifies principle violations"""
    scenario = MoralScenario(
        description="Agent considering deception to achieve good outcome",
        circumstances={"intention": "help_someone", "means": "deception"}
    )
    
    evaluation = synderesis_engine.evaluate(scenario)
    
    assert evaluation.violations
    assert any(v.principle_type == "truthfulness" for v in evaluation.violations)
    assert evaluation.anxiety_level > 0.5

Formation Development Tests
def test_conscience_formation_progression():
    """Test that agent conscience develops appropriately over time"""
    agent = create_test_agent()
    
    # Simulate moral learning experiences
    for scenario in moral_learning_scenarios:
        judgment = agent.make_moral_judgment(scenario)
        outcome = simulate_outcome(judgment)
        agent.learn_from_experience(judgment, outcome)
    
    final_profile = agent.get_conscience_profile()
    initial_profile = agent.initial_conscience_profile
    
    assert final_profile.judgment_accuracy > initial_profile.judgment_accuracy
    assert final_profile.anxiety_appropriateness > initial_profile.anxiety_appropriateness
